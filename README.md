## September 2019

### Background

The Reformed Devs on Slack began doing monthly code challenges a couple of months ago. We decided to begin hosting the challenges in the official TRD namespace for June 2019. You can see the previous challenges below:

* [April 2019](https://github.com/plusuncold/longest-word-test)
* [May 2019](https://github.com/plusuncold/rainfall-calc-challenge)
* [June 2019](https://github.com/ReformedDevs/challenge-2019-06)
* [July 2019](https://github.com/ReformedDevs/challenge-2019-07)

### The Challenge

#### Problem

Find the largest prime number in the Fibonacci sequence under 1,000,000.

#### Output

Use a .sh file to output:
`Author, Language, Result, Time, Notes`

Author should be your Github account name.
Result should be an integer (no `.0`)
Time should be in milliseconds.
Notes do not need to be filled in, that's up to you. Usually people include things like single/multi thread or the algorithm used.

##### Example

The the sequence of Fibonacci numbers under 100 is:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89`

Of the above, `2, 3, 5, 3, 89` are prime. Since `89` is the largest prime in the sequence
this would be the answer.

The output for this, if it was found in Python would be:

`github_username, Python, 89, 30, any notes about the implementation used`

#### Scoring

This will be a time challenge, so users will be scored based on the execution time of their solution in bytes.

### Leaderboard

Author | Language | Result | Time | Notes
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
null | null | null | null | null
